                <li><strong>Pass:</strong> The initial contact made by a player to control the incoming serve or hit.
                    This is typically executed using the
                    forearms and is crucial for setting up the next play.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Set:</strong> The second touch of the ball, often performed with the fingertips to position
                    it for a spike. A well-executed set
                    creates scoring opportunities for the team.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Spike:</strong> The powerful downward hit delivered by an attacking player to send the ball
                    forcefully into the opponent's court.
                    Timing and technique are essential for a successful spike.
